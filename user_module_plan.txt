Intro
-------
- A plan for user.module unit testing via simpletest framework.
- This will replace the existing tests for name+email validation
- See http://www.lastcraft.com/form_testing_documentation.php for technique

Version 1
---------------
* navigate to user/register

submit a few bad usernames and email addresses.
assert that they are rejected

* submit register form with timestamp as email address and name
* assert that all bits hit the users table

* view the user
* assert all is well

* edit user
* assert edits took

* logout
* assert we aren't logged in anymore

* login
* assert we are logged in

* delete our test user from users table

Version 2
-------------------
* - Add a 'deny' mask. Verify it works
* - Distributed Auth
- user_access()
- user administration


* - Implemented by soc project: user_*.test
